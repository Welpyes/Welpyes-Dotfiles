### stuffs atm
- [yasb](https://github.com/Welpyes/Welpyes-Dotfiles?tab=readme-ov-file#yasb-yet-another-status-bar)


## install
you can use `git clone https://github.com/Welpyes/Welpyes-Dotfiles` if you wanna use the sht here


## [Yasb](https://github.com/da-rth/yasb) (yet another status bar)
### its a highly configurable status bar that runs on python
I use this status bar since its fast and really easy to configure
<br />the only downside of using yasb is its currently buggy and the `offset` setting is currently not available.

you can use my setup like [config.yaml](https://github.com/Welpyes/Welpyes-Dotfiles/blob/main/yasb%20stuff/config.yaml) and the [styles.css](https://github.com/Welpyes/Welpyes-Dotfiles/blob/main/yasb%20stuff/styles.css) from here
<br />you can put them in the `\Users\(your user)\.yasb` folder to be able to use them
<br />i'll keep them updated as much as i can.

#### the installation is found in the [Yasb](https://github.com/da-rth/yasb) github page 
### BUT
#### Make sure to use my [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Welpyes/Welpyes-Dotfiles/blob/main/yasb%20stuff/requirements.txt) instead of the one in the [yasb github](https://github.com/da-rth/yasb) since its currently outdated and yasb would not work
put the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Welpyes/Welpyes-Dotfiles/blob/main/yasb%20stuff/requirements.txt) in your `downloads` folder and
open the terminal and use `cd .\Downloads\` and 
<br />then execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`
