## [Yasb](https://github.com/da-rth/yasb) (yet another status bar)
### its a highly configurable status bar that runs on python
I use this status bar since its fast and realy easy to configure
the only downside of using yasb is its currently buggy and the `offset` setting is currently not available.

you can use my files like my [config.yaml](https://github.com/Welpyes/Welpyes-Dotfiles/blob/main/yasb%20stuff/config.yaml) and the [styles.css](https://github.com/Welpyes/Welpyes-Dotfiles/blob/main/yasb%20stuff/styles.css) from here
you can put them in the `\Users\(your user)\.yasb` folder to be able to use them
i'll keep them updated as much as i can.

#### the installation is found in the [Yasb](https://github.com/da-rth/yasb) github page 
### BUT
#### Make sure to use my [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Welpyes/Welpyes-Dotfiles/blob/main/yasb%20stuff/requirements.txt) instead of the one in the yasb github since its currently outdated and yasb would not work
put the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Welpyes/Welpyes-Dotfiles/blob/main/yasb%20stuff/requirements.txt) in your `downloads` folder and
open the terminal and use `cd .\Downloads\` and
then execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`
